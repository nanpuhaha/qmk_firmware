/* Enabling this option changes the startup behavior to listen
for an active USB communication to delegate which part is master
and which is slave. With this option enabled and theresâ€™s USB
communication, then that half assumes it is the master, otherwise
it assumes it is the slave.

Without this option, the master is the half that can detect voltage
on the physical USB connection (VBUS detection).

*/

/* Master/slave delegation is made either by detecting voltage on
VBUS connection or waiting for USB communication (SPLIT_USB_DETECT).
Pro Micro boards can use VBUS detection out of the box and be used
with or without SPLIT_USB_DETECT.

Many ARM boards, but not all, do not support VBUS detection.
Because it is common that ARM boards lack VBUS detection,
SPLIT_USB_DETECT is automatically defined on ARM targets
(technically when ChibiOS is targetted).
